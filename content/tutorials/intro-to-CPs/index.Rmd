Chlorinated Paraffins is a group of alkanes with varying degrees of chlorine substitutions.
Their annual production can be seen below:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

CP <- data.frame(Year = c(2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), Production = c(1000, 1100, 1200, 1300))
plot_ly(data = CP) %>% 
  add_bars(x = ~Year, y = ~Production)

```
